# Discord-themes
Underdark_BG3_Theme is a theme for Vencord,Betterdiscord and others that use css files for their themes.
It's a dark theme with purples and my interpretation of the underdark.
It's my first time creating these themes so I used a lot of help from other themes (thank you ClearVision you were a big help)
Feel free to customize this to your liking.
To use the theme you download the underdark.css file and put it in your discord themes folder.

Thank you :D
