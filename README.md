# Discord-themes
Underdark_BG3_Theme is a theme for Vencord,Betterdiscord and others that use css files for their themes.
It's a dark theme with purples and my interpretation of the underdark.
It's my first time creating these themes so I used a lot of help from other themes (thank you ClearVision you were a big help)
Feel free to customize this to your liking.
To use the theme you download the underdark.css file and put it in your discord themes folder.
If the font isn't working properly open your font settings and make sure you have the century schoolbook font.
I'm planning to make some more themes so they'll be added here after I've finished them.

Thank you :D
